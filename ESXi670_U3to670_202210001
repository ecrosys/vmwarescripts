# Objective: improve / hardening the cibersecurity for VMware 6.7 by patching and fixing specific service, as a first step.

# Update older releases of production servers using VMware ESXi 6.7.0 U3 or older to latest build on the same version 6.7.
# this specific script applies only in this scene, update from Image 6.0.7-201908020001 U3 or older, to 6.0.7-202210001, 
# using latest patch currently available from VMware, a patch dated from OCT 2022, and appliying a measure in service SLP
# following a suggestion by VMware in 2023.
